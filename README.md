Sahara Blockchain Real Estate Platform
How Blockchain Technology is Changing Real Estate
Sahara Platform Core Theory Overview
In the face of the digital economy, it seems that assets can be invested in real
estate. Many investors are showing a lot of interest in the price of real estate
in the future.
In the digital economy, the price of real estate will affect the real estate
market such as housing due to various variables.
Among them, the key is to select representative predictable variables and
examine which variables affect the real estate price and how much.
The Sahara platform is to establish a model for determining real estate prices
empirically.
In order to predict the future real estate market such as housing through
the Sahara platform, the simulation of the independent variable index will
precede.
Effect of Variables
In the traditional real estate market, the price of a Real Estate Value (Vt)
usually is based on standard variables as follows:
• L: Land Value
• B: Building and Apparatus Value
• R: Revenue Producing Value such as Lease and Use Value

Therefore, the Real Estate Value in the traditional market can be expressed in
the following equation:
Vt = L+B+R
However, the Real Estate Value in the digital market (Vd) will be influenced by
additional factors in comparison to the traditional Real Estate Value (Vt).
One must consider the following additional factors:
• N: N represents the contribution of the total number of Real Estate
Brokers/Agents (N). In Sahara Street’s case, we shall call it “Sahara Node”
represented by “N” in the below equation.
• F: F is an important factor, which represents the value that will be brought
by “Followers” of the Brokers/Agents, meaning their customers and
collaborators. This F shall be called “Node Follower”, and this number reflects
the market demand that can affect the value, meaning the higher demand
leads to a higher overall value, Vd. In addition, the Node Follower will also be
rewarded based on their contribution in the process, which gives them
incentives for higher motivation.
• I: I depict the value introduced by Investment in the digital market
• X: X is a variable that affects the above-referenced factors based on
market conditions, including the location of the property and the average
condition of the digital market. X is introduced, in order to adequately reflect
the market fluctuation of the digital market as well as the value-added by
“sharing” and “digitalized asset” in the digital market.

Value Prediction
Therefore, one can express the process of predicting the value of a real
estate property in the digital market in the following manner:
Vd = Vt + (N*F*I)*X
In comparison between the traditional real estate and digital market, if a real
estate property is digitalized, then it is obvious that the digitalized asset shall
have the additional path to incorporate the market demand and interest,
which explain in “N”, “F” and “I” in the above mathematical expression.
